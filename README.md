# Wordscapes Clone

## [Demo](https://crossword.deploy.sadpanda.moe/)

My attempt at emulating a mobile game that gives you characters and you have to find out the words in a crossword puzzle. There's no real vernacular knowledge needed since you've given the character set for each puzzle.

This is right after a quick intro to both typescript and sass so I just picked the next project in my big list of projects and went at it.
Typescript seemed more of a hindrance initially since it was fumbling around trying to get the darn thing compiled first. Once I had some boilerplate for the reducers and redux->props class strucutres, the typescript was definitely more helpful. The initial hurdle is so painful to get over though that unless I can find some typescript redux boilerplate, I'm going to have to avoid it.
Sass seemed more of an eh thing. I didn't abuse the power of it too much other than the ability to nest stuff. I have to say, that is some really nice stuff. Would definitely use it in another project. The setup was very simple to get it working and I think I'll throw this into most of my projects from now on.
